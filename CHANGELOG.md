# Changelog

## [0.31.0](https://github.com/cerebral-work/lnr/compare/v0.30.0...v0.31.0) (2026-10-26)


### Features

* **agent:** add bounded transports and Cortex MCP evidence tools ([4db4a0b](https://github.com/cerebral-work/lnr/commit/4db4a0b47d07479d648ce431d41ce5abc60d6968))
* **agent:** add bounded transports and Cortex MCP evidence tools ([9e522ba](https://github.com/cerebral-work/lnr/commit/9e522ba84c4ba02ebb88d9e99c28b182270b588e))

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Read-only MCP mode, issue-scoped comment readback with pagination, and bounded Cortex repository observations in both runtimes.
- `lnr show` returns the issue's comments (`comments.nodes`, first 50, with `pageInfo`) and names the count in the human summary; before this the JSON had no `comments` key, so a read-back after `lnr comment` looked like a failed write.

### Fixed

- Replace the native milestone-list empty stub with real, paginated Linear reads and explicit partial-page evidence.

- Negotiate native MCP protocol versions and report malformed/oversized frames; keep structured results within native token budgets.
- Bound GraphQL request deadlines and reject missing/invalid data instead of reporting empty success.
- Preserve Unicode across fragmented operator socket frames, enforce byte limits, and dispatch one request per connection.

## [Unreleased]

### Breaking Changes

* **cli:** standardize exits (0 success, 2 usage, 3 auth, 4 not found, 5 rate limit, 6 refused, 1 other); dry-run write previews and partial batch failures now return nonzero. JSON failures use one stderr envelope.

### Agent tooling

* **cli:** add command-specific invocation hints, team/label suggestions, and embedded `examples [command]` shell scripts.


### Features

* **milestone:** filter `pull` and `search` by milestone UUID/name; include milestone identity and target date in `show` for membership verification.

* **milestone:** `milestone create` subcommand — create project milestones headless (CER-1686)
* **project:** `project update` subcommand — update project state, name, description (CER-1687)
* **roadmap:** milestone timeline view with progress and issue lists per milestone (CER-1688)
* **watch:** `linearctl watch --once --payload` — full-loop fallback path for AgentSessionEvent payloads; loop driver library (`emitThought` → `driveAgentLoop` → `moveToStartedIfDelegated`) with 10s-SLA thought-first ordering (CER-1149)
* **operator:** `linearctl operator` long-running daemon — CF Queue `linear-agent-events` consumer + Unix-socket control (POST /delegate, GET /healthz) for `linearctl watch` delegation; token cache, graceful SIGINT/SIGTERM shutdown (CER-1149)
* **handoff:** `linearctl handoff` command tree — create / list / show / resolve session handoff notes persisted as markdown under `~/.local/state/linearctl/handoffs/` (XDG state dir shared with the operator socket); cross-session memory bridge for the maintainer-agent (Track 6 sub-feature B)


### Bug Fixes

* **file:** `--stdin` dry-run now validates project name resolution so the preview matches `--apply` (CER-1604)
* **operator:** make readiness and drain timing monotonic, acknowledge each queue message exactly once, keep authenticated queue response bodies out of logs, and remove CI-only test races.
* **roles:** escape backslashes before pipes in intake-triage Markdown table titles.
* **image:** remove the deleted react-devtools stub from the container build context so rootless BuildKit can compile the operator image.
